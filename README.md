## Portfolio Projects

### World Happiness Report Analysis
**Source:** [WHR Analysis](https://github.com/romaoeh/WHR/tree/a75b496a72fd80399c5349793b105847f85ae1b3)

**Objective:**
<br>  Find what factors contribute most to the Happiness Score across different countries. Which countries are the happiest versus which are the most unhappy? 
<br>  Is there a relationship between GDP Per Capita and the Happiness Score? Can money, in fact, buy happiness?
<br>  Is there a correlation between Perceptions of Corruption and Confidence in National Government? Do the injustices of corruption lower a societyâ€™s political trust?
 
 **Description:**
<br> The dataset is a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and contains several predictors with ratings of their level of perceived happiness from each country globally. 

 **Skills:**
<br>  data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization
 **Technology:**
<br>  Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Powerpoint, Excel, Google Docs, Jupyter Notebook

 **Results:**
<br> The Top 10 Countries with the highest Happiness Scores and GDP are Finland, Denmark, Israel, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Australia.

<br>  The Bottom 10 Countries with the lowest Happiness Scores and GDP are Egypt, Jordan, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Malawi, India, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Afghanistan, and Lebanon.

<br>  There is an overall correlation that suggests happiness increases in countries with higher GDP Per Capita's.

<br>  There is an overall correlation that suggests when a country has more corruption, their confidence in the national government also decreases. This also suggests a decrease in happiness.
 
### Housing Price Factors
 **Source:** [Housing Price Investments](https://github.com/romaoeh/Housing-Price-Investments/tree/6bba63aad6c7e54100d3449bc8ebcd799cd1a2a4)

 **Objective:**
<br>  The objective of this project is to provide data-driven insights to my client, an investment bank, on the factors that drive home prices.

<br>  By analyzing the housing prices data, I aim to identify the most important variables that impact home prices, so that my client can make informed decisions on how to allocate investment dollars into mortgage-backed securities.

 **Description:**
<br>  Analysis of housing prices data as part of a Thinkful Data Analytics case study for a financial institution. The purpose of this analysis was to gain insights into home buyers purchase trends and discover how my client should allocate dollars earmarked for investment into mortgage-backed securities.

 **Skills:**
<br>   data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, A/B testing with T-Tests, PivotTables, PivotCharts, data visualization

 **Technology:**
<br>  Excel, Google Docs, PowerPoint, Tableau
  
 **Results:**
<br>  Through the analysis of the housing prices data, I have identified several key factors that drive residential home sale prices. By incorporating my findings and recommendations into the allocation of investment dollars into mortgage-backed securities, my client can enhance the chances of making profitable investment decisions based on the factors driving home prices in the market.
